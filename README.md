# DuckyDiagnostic

A small troubleshooter using the PicoDucky

This is being subbmitted to Hack Club's YSWS [PicoDucky](picoducky.hackclub.com). A PicoDucky is a custon PCB that acts as a HID device and is open soursed on Github [here](https://github.com/Outdatedcandy92/PicoDucky).

## My project

When the USB is plugged in, press the button one to three times to signal the OS. This opens a terminal and runs several commands to gather information about the computer and automatically perform OS-specific troubleshooting steps. 

__Note__: _The current version uses the ```keyboard``` and ```platform``` librarys instead of Pico Dukcky Code for now!

## How to run (python)

- Make sure python is installed

- Use ```git clone https://github.com/hippogriff101/DuckyDiagnostic``` or download ```main.py``` from the releases tab (under devlopment)

- Install all required dependenceys:

```
keyboard
platform
```

- Run ```main.py```

(a ```.exe``` and PicoDucky compatible version is in development)

# AI Transparency

Ai was used in this project to assist in debuging code and learning the ```powershell``` and ```terminal``` commands that the script uses.

(UNFINISHED!!!! TBC...)
